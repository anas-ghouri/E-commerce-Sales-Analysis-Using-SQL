-- Advanced KPIs & Retention Metrics

-- Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
-- (Total revenue each customer has contributed to date)

SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS lifetime_value
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
ORDER BY lifetime_value DESC;

-- Find the first and latest order date of each customer, also find active days of each customer

select c.customer_id, c.name,

from customers c
join orders o
on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
group by c.customer_id, c.name

-- Find repeat customers (more than 1 order)

from customers c
join orders o
on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
group by c.customer_id, c.name

-- Segment customers based on lifetime value:

select c.customer_id, c.name, sum(o.total_amount) as lifetime_value,
case
	when sum(o.total_amount) > 1000 then 'Gold'
    when sum(o.total_amount) between 500 and 1000 then 'Silver'
    else 'Bronze'
end as customer_tier

join orders o
on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
group by c.customer_id, c.name
order by lifetime_value desc;

-- Customer Retention Analysis (Repeat Orders by Month)
-- Track customer retention by checking how many customers placed repeat orders month by month

-- Step 1: Identify first order month and compare with each order
WITH orders_with_months AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS order_month,
        MIN(DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m')) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS first_order_month
    FROM orders
)

-- Step 2: Count repeat customers (orders after their first month)
SELECT 
    order_month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS repeat_customers
FROM orders_with_months
WHERE order_month > first_order_month
GROUP BY order_month
ORDER BY order_month;
